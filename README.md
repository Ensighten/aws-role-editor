# "AWS Role Editor" extension for Google Chrome

This is a Google Chrome extension to manage roles from the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Console Cross Account delegation
(More about that [here](
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/walkthru_cross-account-with-roles.html)).

Currently this extension allows the following:
* Rename the display name
* Change account and role
* Modify the backgroundcolor

### Download
From the Google Chrome Webstore  
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aws-role-editor/fefjjiapooggkhiicnofcmlknjgpinop?hl=de

### Security
Because many people, including myself, are very sensitive using third party tools in AWS, you can check the code or compile the extension on your own.
